The inverted cart pendulum system serves as a classic benchmark problem for studying the control of dynamical systems, featuring a cart connected to a pole along a track. This system presents a challenging control problem due to its non-linear, unstable and under-actuated dynamics.

The objective in this repository, is to determine the optimal action selection policy using a Q-learning algorithm to maintain upright balance of the pole by forcing the cart to the left or right. The environment developed discretizes the continuous state space, drawing inspiration from Gymâ€™s cart-pole environment. Acheiving the optimal action selection policy is obtain through careful tuning of the Q-learning parameters.

The short clip above displays the resulting dynamics of the inverted cart pendulum when controlled by the action selection policy obtained from the Q-learning model.
